We've learned a multiple neural network, but there is one problem - processing time. You can use batch processing to reduce it.

Batch processing is to execute a program by a set of data (batch). Most of libraries are highly optimized for array calculation and it is suitable for deep learning.

Let's change the logic of accuracy calculation from *04_recognition.py* in [Deep Learning 4]({{site.github.url}}/2017/04/09/recognition.html).

<div class="filename"><span class="t">04_recognition.py</span></div>
``` python
x, t = get_data()
network = init_network()
accuracy_cnt = 0
for i in range(len(x)):
    y = predict(network, x[i])
    p = np.argmax(y)
    if p == t[i]:
        accuracy_cnt += 1

print("Accuracy:" + str(float(accuracy_cnt) / len(x)))
```
<br>
<div class="filename"><span class="t">05_batch.py</span></div>
``` python
x, t = get_data()
network = init_network()

batch_size = 100
accuracy_cnt = 0

for i in range(0, len(x), batch_size):
    x_batch = x[i:i+batch_size]
    y_batch = predict(network, x_batch)
    p = np.argmax(y_batch, axis=1)
    accuracy_cnt += np.sum(p == t[i:i+batch_size])

print("Accuracy:" + str(float(accuracy_cnt) / len(x)))
```

The step is to divide the data in the batch size, predict them with each array, extract the maximum value, and calculate accuracy. It is repeated in each batch. As a result, you can get accuracy faster! This dataset is not so large, but batch processing exerts an effect in time when you manipulate big data.
