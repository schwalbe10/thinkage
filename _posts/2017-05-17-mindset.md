Human-centered design is a creative approach to solve intractable problems such as poverty. It is based on understanding a target people, generating a huge amount of ideas, and building a number of prototypes.

There are three phases in human-centered design; Inspiration, Ideation, and Implementation (I'll explain them in other posts). Before you learn the process, you should understand the mindset.

First of all, it is important to believe in yourself. Optimism is the embrace of possibility, and you can come up with creative solutions. Accumulation of your small success results in great achievement.

Failure and ambiguity are source of learning. You have no answer to solve a problem in most cases, so it is necessary to understand the people from things that doesn't work. Thomas Edison said,

> I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.

You have to make your solutions real and iterate it. Feedback from the people is essential for human-centered design. The most important thing in the process is emphasize. Recognizing different people, scenarios, and places is foundation of new solutions!
