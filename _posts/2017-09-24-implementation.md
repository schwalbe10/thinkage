The last phase of human-centered design is implementation. You'll find the way how to carry out your idea and how to maximize its impact. It is necessary to consider resources and sustainability.

## Resource Assessment

You need to assess the feasibility of your solution. What can your team do? Which field do you leave to your partners? These questions lead the practical implementation of your idea.

1. Understand the distribution of your solution
1. List what you've got and what you'll need
1. Identify the scope of your team and other partners

## Funding

This is a short-term financial approach. In many cases, you can't run your project without money. It's best to plan a funding strategy from the start.

1. Discuss with your key stakeholders about money you need
1. Determine the relationships for grants
1. Plan the way to raise money (Cloud funding, stock, sales, donation, etc.)

## Sustainable Revenue

A long term revenue strategy is core to deliver your idea. You've got the right revenue strategy to continue the development.

1. Make a projection of future operations
1. Plan the way to raise money (Cloud funding, stock, sales, donation, etc.)
1. Think about scaling your project in the long term
